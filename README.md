# Project-4
# Insight of Trend one 
- The bar plots show the average capital gain (left) and education num (right) for different income groups. 
  - We observe that higher income groups tend to have both higher average capital gains and higher average education levels. 
  - This suggests a positive association between income, education, and capital gain, indicating that individuals with higher education levels may have access to better income opportunities and investment options, leading to higher capital gains.
 
# insights of Trend 2 
- In this box plot, each box represents the distribution of income for different levels of education. The vertical axis represents the income levels, while the horizontal axis represents the education level, indicated by education num. We observe that higher education levels tend to be associated with higher incomes, as evidenced by the increasing median income across higher education num categories. 
- This suggests that there is a positive correlation between education level and income, highlighting the importance of education in determining individuals' earning potential.
